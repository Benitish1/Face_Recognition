Face Recognition Using MediaPipe, LBPH & OCR

This project implements a real-time Face Recognition system built with MediaPipe for face detection and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for face recognition and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction.
It allows you to train custom faces and recognize them through a webcam feed with high accuracy and speed.

🚀 Features

Great performance on small datasets

Robust to changes in lighting and pose

🔹 OCR (Text Extraction)

Extracts printed text from images

Powered by Tesseract OCR

Supports multiple image formats

🔹 General System Features

Live webcam recognition

Dataset creation support

Saves trained model for fast reuse

Clean and easy-to-edit codebase
